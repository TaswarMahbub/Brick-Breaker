This file is to set a couple of standards that will be helpful as we build the game (specifically 
relating to the environment of the game)

(All units are in pixels)

Ball: 9x9 in pyramid shape in order to be 'circular' as seen below (each 'x' is a pixel)

       x x x        row of 3 pixels
     x x x x x      row of 5 pixels
   x x x x x x x    row of 7 pixels
 x x x x x x x x x  row of 9 pixels
 x x x x x x x x x  row of 9 pixels
 x x x x x x x x x  row of 9 pixels
   x x x x x x x    row of 7 pixels
     x x x x x      row of 5 pixels
       x x x        row of 3 pixels
       (naming is based off of the names used in the pattern module)
       -ball_x: The x coordinate for the center of the ball
       -ball_y: The y coordinate for the center of the ball

Paddle: 80x10 rectangle
        -paddle_x: the x coordinate for the first column of pixels for the paddle
        -y values: The paddle's center row is 450 with its upper row being 455

Screen: 512x480
        -The screen starts at pixel column 63 and ends at pixel column 574
        -The screen starts at pixel row 9 and ends at the bottom of the screen, at row 480

Bricks: TBD
